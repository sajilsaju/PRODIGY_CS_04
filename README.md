# PRODIGY_CS_04
## Introduction
The Simple Keylogger is a basic Python-based tool that records and logs keystrokes. It captures the keys pressed by the user and logs them into a text file. This project is intended for educational purposes and ethical use only, such as monitoring your own system's activity or for learning about how keyloggers work. Ethical considerations and permissions are crucial for any projects involving keyloggers.

### Features
- Keystroke Logging: Captures and records every key pressed.
- Special Key Handling: Recognizes and logs special keys like Space, Enter, and Escape.
- File Logging: Logs all captured keystrokes into a text file for later review.
- Simple and Lightweight: Easy-to-use with minimal setup required.
## Installation

### Clone the Repository:
- git clone https://github.com/sajilsaju/PRODIGY_CS_04.git

### Install Required Dependencies:
The keylogger requires the pynput library. Install it using:
- pip install pynput

### Usage
To use the Simple Keylogger, run the Python script in your terminal:
- python keylogger.py

The keylogger will start capturing keystrokes and logging them into a file named key_log.txt in the same directory.

### Stopping the Keylogger
The keylogger will stop recording when the Esc key is pressed
